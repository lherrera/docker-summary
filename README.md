# docker-summary
Organizes and displays Docker Host, Docker Engine and Docker Registry configuration details. 


## Motivation
The output of "docker info" could be consufing at times. As you start using different docker enviroments - Docker on Mac, Docker Toolbox, Docker Swarm - and engines becomes more and more important to understand to what host, engine and registry you are connected to. As a trainer andn consultant, neededed to delegates to clearly understand which Docker env we were using at each stage.
